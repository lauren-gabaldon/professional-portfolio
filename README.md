# professional-portfolio

This page is my portfolio for future projects. As I go further
into my software coding program I aim to not only add new work into my image links, but to also apply skills learned along the way to improve the general format and styling of my web page as well. Should all go to plan this portfolio will make me more marketable in this new field and open doors to more opportunities.

## Whats been applied along the way so far?

This code utilizes a lot of FlexBox to position my content. FlexBox has up to this point been a journey to grasp and while I've learned a lot of material on this layout type I haven't mastered it enough to get as intricate as I can with design potential _yet_. For now my FlexBox use in this code is functional while still presentable.

### Problems solved

Flex direction and align elements were my main elements for this code up to this point (4/19/2021) for maintaining balance amongst my links and text. Using Rem units for my font size did affect my code for sizing the width and height of my image links when trying to use pixels so I ended up using Rem for those containers as well.

#### Does this project stand out?

While the code used at this time has been more simple, the page itself looks very clean and is user friendly. There's not much distraction from my links while also drawing enough attention in to keep the user curious to explore more than just one item from the page.
